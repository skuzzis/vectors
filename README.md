## Why Vectors and what is it?

SA:MP Vectors are vectors from C++ adapted to PAWN. It's more like YSI Iterators, but with more speed and very flexible. SA:MP Vectors contains a lot of useful features, including an Foreach to go trought all elements of it.

## When was made Vectors and what was the reason of developing it?

SA:MP Vectors were started on 10th June 2021 and the first release was made on 14th June 2021, than it was recoded on 5th July 2021. It has been developed in 2 full days and then only bug fixes. The reason of developing it was to improve the efficiency of YSI's Iterators, to make them faster and efficient in my opinion.
